Create an e-commerce website, with authentication and payment gateways in React, Redux and Firebase. 

## Install dependencies

In your terminal after you clone your project down, remember to run either `yarn` or `npm install` to build all the dependencies in the project.

## Run on your PC
In your terminal, navigate to this projects directory and run `npm start`. This might take some time depending upon your PC, but it sure will shoot up a new tab in your default browser opening `http://localhost:3000`
